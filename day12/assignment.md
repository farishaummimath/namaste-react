## 1. useContext vs Redux

useContext is a React Hook that lets you read and subscribe to context from your component.
Call useContext at the top level of your component to read and subscribe to context.

```
const value = useContext(SomeContext)
function MyComponent() {
    const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);
}
```
