# what is JSX?

    JSX is a Markup language used in order to create React elements. The markup can be used to represent a standalone single component or a complex component. The syntax for writing JSX is:
<OpeningTag>...Content...</ClosingTag>
<OpeningTag />
A typical component in React would look like:
<div>This is a div</div> // displays a block of text
<Clock timezone="gmt" /> // displays a clock with the current time
