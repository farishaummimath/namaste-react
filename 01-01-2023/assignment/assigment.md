## what is JSX?

    JSX is a Markup language used in order to create React elements. The markup can be used to represent a standalone single component or a complex component. The syntax for writing JSX is:
        ``` 
        <Component>...Content...</Component>
        A typical component in React would look like:
        <div>This is a div</div> // displays a block of text
        <Clock timezone="gmt" /> // displays a clock with the current time
        
        ```

##  Superpowers of JSX
    
    * Embedding Expressions in JSX
        ```
        const name = 'Josh Perez';
        const element = <h1>Hello, {name}</h1>;
        
        ```
    * JSX is an Expression Too
      
      After compilation, JSX expressions become regular JavaScript function calls and evaluate to   JavaScript objects.
