## Difference between a Library and Framework?

    * Both frameworks and libraries are code written by someone else that is used to help solve common problems.
    * The technical difference between a framework and a library lies in the inversion of control.
    * When an application code uses a library, the developer writing the code is in charge of the application flow. 
      This means the developer decides when to call the library. 
    * However, when we use a framework, the framework decides when to call the library. 
      This shift in control of calling the library from the application  code to the framework is an inversion of control.
